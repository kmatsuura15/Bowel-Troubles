Your final grade is determined based on story, description, and gameplay mechanics. Please describe and discuss:

How well does the game accomplish what you set out to do?
My game does exactly what I wanted my game to accomplish.  I wanted the player to go to ridiculous lengths just to use the Bathroom, and that's what you need to do to win.

Discuss a time when you got stuck, and how you got unstuck.
One time I was stuck was when I wanted to create an Instead rule for leaving Longs.  I wanted the player to lose the game if they stole the medicine without hiding it in the secret container.  I had no idea what verb to use for my rule.  I was able to get unstuck by the help of my classmates.  I learned that the Instead rule was: "Instead of going north from longs:"


Describe each of the required three puzzles in your game and how to solve each puzzle.
The first puzzle is getting the medicine to the guy stuck on the toilet.  You can solve the puzzle by trading your change for the Hobo's secret container. With the secret container you can steal the medicine from longs without getting caught by the Security Guard.  The second puzzle is finding a way to steal the Silver Key from the Old Man without him noticing.  To do this, you have to put a sleeping drug in the man's cup; so when he drinks his coffee, he will fall asleep.  The third puzzle is finding a way to open the Bathroom Door.  To do this you need to turn off the Security Camera in the gun store by switching on the red switch in the Security Room.  After you turn the Security Camera off, you can steal the gun from the gun store without getting caught and using the gun to shoot open the Bathroom door.  


Discuss the gameplay mechanics in your game and how they improve the user's experience.
All the puzzles in my game are connected.  If you do the first puzzle, then it leads to the second one, and then third one.  I created my game like this so new players always know the objective and don't get confused.  In my game, the man behind the bathroom door gives you hints at what you need to do to open the bathroom door.  This allows to player to not get confused on what they have to do while playing.  Also the way the game is coded makes the player do certain things before they can do other things.

Discuss the beta testing process: Who tested your game?Ê
My friend Josh played my game.  He never knew IF existed so there was a learning curve for him.  After he got the hang of learning the actions, he was able to enjoy and criticize my game.  He liked how he always knew what he had to do in order to move on in the game.  He gave me tips on creating new Instead rules and actions.  Also he reminded me that even though certain things in their game had already served their purpose not to just forget about them.  For example, when you talk to the Hobo you try to get him to give you the Secret Container.  I forgot that once the player gets the secret container the Hobo's dialogue doesn't change.  So, he I created an Instead rule that changed the Hobo's dialogue depending on if the player has already gotten the secret container from the Hobo.

How did their feedback affect your game?Ê
The feedback my friend game me improved my game.

Whose game did you beta test?Ê
I didn't beta test anyone's game because I was sick on the day we were supposed to.

What feedback were you able to give?
Well, I was able to teach someone on how to create new actions.  But I didn't give feedback other than that because I was sick during the class we were beta testing.

What are you most proud of?
The thing I'm most proud of is knowing I was able to create an IF game that, from what I think, is fun.

What would you do differently next time?
Next time I would add more description to Strip 1 and Strip 2.
