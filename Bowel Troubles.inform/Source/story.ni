"Bowel Troubles" by Kyler Matsuura

When play begins:
	say "Did anyone else hear that? I was just trying to do a downward dog.  Why did my body have to betray me like that?  I hope no one smells thatâ€¦  My stomach really hurts.  I should use the restroom"
	
Yoga Studio is a room.  The description of the room is "You can see everyone else in a downward dog position on his or her yoga mat."
