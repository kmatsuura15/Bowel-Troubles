Bowel Troubles
An Interactive Fiction by Kyler Matsuura
Release 1 / Serial number 140225 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Yoga Studio
You and your Yoga Instructor are the only people in the room.  You were having a private yoga session because your psychiatrist recommended it would help; You know, with your anger issues and such.  In the corner of the room, your wallet and sleeping medicine sits on the stack of yoga mats right where you left them. 

You can see a Restroom Door and Yoga Instructor here.

Happy Shooting
This gun store is void of all life.  The interior of the store is a very dull grey color that is completely opposite of the store&apos;s name. In the back of the room, there is a register and a cabinent that is filled with guns.  In the top corner of the room, there is a security camera that can that view your every move.  Just outside the camera&apos;s view is a door.

You can see a metal door and a Cabinent (closed) here.
